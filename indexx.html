      About Me!
    </h1>
    <p class="green">
      I've always been interested in coding since elementary school. The first
      very serious coding experience that I had was a python coding course that
      I took in summer of 2020. I want to continue coding whether it be website
      design or game design. I really enjoy website design currently.

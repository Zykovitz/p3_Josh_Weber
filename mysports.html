    <h2>My favorite sport is Tennis</h2>
    <p>
      Tennis began as an indoor game called jeu de paume (palm game) in medieval
      France. From France, tennis spread across Europe; it took firm hold in
      England in the 16th and 17th centuries. By 1875 lawn tennis had become so
      popular that the All England Croquet Club dedicated one of its courts at
      Wimbledon to tennis; the next year the club became known as the All
      England Lawn Tennis Croquet and Club. The first Wimbledon tennis
      tournament was held there in 1877. The scoring still used today dates from
      medieval times. A clock face may have been used to keep score; thus the
      four points needed to win a game were quarters of 60—15, 30, 40
      (abbreviated from 45), and game.
